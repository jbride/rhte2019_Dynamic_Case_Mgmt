== Overview
In this lab we will experiment with the dynamic tasks creation: An administrative user wants to create a Human Task that was not initially defined during the case design. Case Management is very flexible, it allows the knowledge worker to change the case usage during run time including: permissions, tasks, case information, documents and comments.

=== Background
During the interview process one of the interviewers detects that this user can be a good fit for a different position, so asks another user to interview the candidate; the new assigned group or user realizes that this is a good fit and changes the interviewer team and the job to which this user is applying to.
