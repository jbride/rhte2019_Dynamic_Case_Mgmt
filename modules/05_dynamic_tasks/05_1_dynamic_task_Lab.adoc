= Case Management Dynamic Tasks

.Prerequisites
.. Execute Setup Lab.
.. Web browser installed on your laptop.
.. Broadband internet connectivity.
.. link:https://account.opentlc.com/account/[Red Hat GPTE _Opentlc_ userId]

:numbered:


== Overview
In this lab we will experiment with the dynamic tasks creation: An administrative user wants to create a Human Task that was not initially defined during the case design. Case Management is very flexible, it allows the knowledge worker to change the case usage during run time including: permissions, tasks, case information, documents and comments.

=== Background
During the interview process one of the interviewers detects that this user can be a good fit for a different position, so asks another user to interview the candidate; the new assigned group or user realizes that this is a good fit and changes the interviewer team and the job to which this user is applying to.

== Import and Browse the project contents

In this section we will import and overview the contents of the client applications source code.
Then we will create a container with a pre-created image in a new project in Openshift; in a later exercise we will make changes to these applications and deploy to openshift, for now let's see them in action.

=== Import the client applications source code.

We will import the code from the following repositories:

* https://github.com/barhte2019/hiring-app-internal
* https://github.com/barhte2019/hiring-app-public

We will use `git clone` to import the repositories. It is recommended to use the `ssh workshop environment`, because it has `git` installed and in a later lab we will modify the source code and deploy our modification to Openshift. If you locally have `git` installed, you can perform the source code analysis locally.

==== Import and build the client applications

. In the `ssh workshop terminal`, use the `$HOME/lab` directory
+
----
cd $HOME/lab
----

. Run the `git clone` command for importing the hiring-app-internal:
+
----
git clone https://github.com/barhte2019/hiring-app-internal.git
----

. Clone the `hiring-app-public` application:
+
----
cd $HOME/lab
git clone https://github.com/barhte2019/hiring-app-public.git
----
== Change the UI for Dynamic tasks creation
=== The current UI analysis
=== Implementing and deploying the change
=== Deploy client applications to Openshift
In this section we will create Docker containers and push them to Openshift so we can create containers from them.
The ssh workstation has all the software components required for the following steps to work, if you want to execute this section locally you will need:

* *buildah*: for building an image.
* *OCP Client Utility*: (`oc`) for pushing the image to our openshift environment.
* A good internet band-width for uploading the image to Openshift.

To prepare for pushing these images to Openshift:

. Create a namespace in openshift to receive the images and create containers in it:

----
oc login https://master00.example.com -u user1 -p r3dh4t1!
oc new-project client-app
----

. Switch to openshift administrator access:

+
----
sudo -i
----

. Switch to the `default` project

+
----
oc project default
----

. Create an openshift route to the internal registry of your Openshift cluster

+
----
oc create route passthrough docker-registry-demo --service=docker-registry
----

. Setup an environment variable for the `docker-registry-demo` remote URL

+
----
export DOCKER_REGISTRY_HOSTNAME=$(oc get route docker-registry-demo -n default -o template --template='{{.spec.host}}')
----

. Use the `client-app` project

+
----
oc project client-app
----

. Create a pusher service account

+
----
oc create serviceaccount pusher
----

. Add `system:image-builder` and `edit` to `pusher` service account

+
----
oc policy add-role-to-user system:image-builder system:serviceaccount:client-app:pusher
oc policy add-role-to-user edit system:serviceaccount:client-app:pusher
----

. Exit the use of `root`

+
----
exit
----

==== The back office application
. Prepare the values that you will use in the client application configuration, take note (copy them to an available text editor so you can retrieve them in a later step) of the following variable values in the `workstation ssh`, we will use them in the next step:

+
----
echo -en "\n\nhttps://$rhsso_url/auth\n\n
echo -en "\n\nhttps://$ks_url\n\n
----

. Use the `workshop ssh` terminal to configure the environment variables inside the Dockerfile that will be used to build the `hiring-app-internal` image.

+
----
cd $HOME/lab/hiring-app-internal
vi Dockerfile
----

. Using the vi editor, set the proper values to the ENV values:

+
|===
|Get The Value From|Assign to ENV in file|Example
|`echo -en "\n\nhttps://$rhsso_url/auth\n\n"`| REACT_APP_RHSSO_URL |`ENV REACT_APP_RHSSO_URL=https://sso-rhsso-sso0.apps-af16.generic.opentlc.com/auth`
|`echo -en "\n\nhttps://$ks_url\n\n"`| REACT_APP_KIE_SERVER_URL |`ENV REACT_APP_KIE_SERVER_URL=https://rhpam-kieserver-rhpam-dev-user1.apps-af16.generic.opentlc.com`
|===

+
[NOTE]
====
`REACT_APP_RHSSO_REALM` and `REACT_APP_RHSSO_CLIENT` current values assume that you completed the creation of a Red Hat SSO client named as `kie-remote` in the `kie-realm`. If you perform a different operation in previous sections changing any of these names, please also perform the appropriate changes in the respective environment entry.
====

. Build the `hiring-app-internal` image using *buildah*:

+
----
cd $HOME/lab/hiring-app-internal
sudo buildah bud -t hiring-app-internal:1.0 .
----

. Get the token id for the `pusher` service account in openshift and save it in an environment variable.

+
----
export SA_TOKEN_ID=$(oc describe sa pusher -n client-app | grep Tokens | awk '{print $2}')
echo $SA_TOKEN_ID
----

. Discover the value of the `pusher` service account token and store that value in an environment variable

+
----
export SA_TOKEN=$(oc describe secret $SA_TOKEN_ID -n client-app | grep token: | awk '{print $2}')
echo $SA_TOKEN
----

. Push the image to the openshift registry

+
----
sudo buildah push --tls-verify=false --creds=pusher:$SA_TOKEN hiring-app-internal:1.0 docker-registry-demo-default.apps-8735.generic.opentlc.com/client-app/hiring-app-internal:1.0
----

. In openshift, create a container based in the pushed image.

+
----
oc new-app hiring-app-internal:1.0 -n client-app
----

. Expose the external route to be able to navigate to the `hiring-app-internal`

+
----
oc expose hiring-app-internal -n client-app
----

. Retrieve and navigate using a browser to the newly created back office web application.

+
----
oc get route -n client-app
----

. Login to the client application as *adminuser/admin1!*

. Congratulations you have installed the back office application.

==== The public web application
In this section you repeat almost the same steps than in previous section, to create a container based in the git repository for the `hiring-app-public`: https://github.com/barhte2019/hiring-app-public

. Prepare the values that you will use in the client application configuration, take note (copy them to an available text editor so you can retrieve them in a later step) of the following variable values in the `workstation ssh`, we will use them in the next step:

+
----
echo -en "\n\nhttps://$rhsso_url/auth\n\n
echo -en "\n\nhttps://$ks_url\n\n
----

. Use the `workshop ssh` terminal to configure the environment variables inside the Dockerfile that will be used to build the `hiring-app-internal` image.

+
----
