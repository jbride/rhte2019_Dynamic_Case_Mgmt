= Case Management Dynamic Tasks

.Prerequisites
.. Execute Setup Lab.
.. Web browser installed on your laptop.
.. Broadband internet connectivity.
.. link:https://account.opentlc.com/account/[Red Hat GPTE _Opentlc_ userId]

:numbered:


== Overview
In this lab you will experiment with the dynamic tasks creation: An administrative user wants to create a Human Task that was not initially defined during the case design. Case Management is very flexible, it allows the knowledge worker to change the case usage during run time including: permissions, tasks, case information, documents and comments.

=== Background
During the interview process one of the interviewers detects that this user can be a good fit for a different position, so asks another user to interview the candidate; the new assigned group or user realizes that this is a good fit and changes the interviewer team and the job to which this user is applying to.

== Import and Browse the project contents

In this section you will import and overview the contents of the client applications source code.
Then we will create a container with a pre-created image in a new project in Openshift.

=== Import the client applications source code.

You will import the code from the following repositories:

* https://github.com/barhte2019/hiring-app-internal
* https://github.com/barhte2019/hiring-app-public

You will use `git clone` to import the repositories. It is recommended to use the `ssh workshop environment`, because it has `git` installed and in a later lab we will modify the source code and deploy our modification to Openshift. If you locally have `git` installed, you can perform the source code analysis locally.

==== Import and build the client applications

. In the `ssh workshop terminal`, use the `$HOME/lab` directory
+
----
cd $HOME/lab
----

. Run the `git clone` command for importing the hiring-app-internal:
+
----
git clone https://github.com/barhte2019/hiring-app-internal.git
----

. Clone the `hiring-app-public` application:
+
----
cd $HOME/lab
git clone https://github.com/barhte2019/hiring-app-public.git
----


== Change the UI for Dynamic tasks creation

. Add a `createDynamic` method to the `Api` handler.
. Add a button to the `Tasks` component.
. Add a dynamic task form (email like) to describe the dynamic task.
. Add types to support the dynamic task creation.
. Add actions to interact with the API and bridge the events of the form and buttons in the components.
. Add reducer to communicate the state changes after the action `dispatches`.
. Register the reducer in the `store`.
. Validate that your code builds.

=== Deploy client applications to Openshift
In this section you create Docker images and push them to Openshift so you can create containers from them.
The ssh workstation has all the software components required for the following steps to work, if you want to execute this section locally you will need:

* *buildah*: for building an image.
* *OCP Client Utility*: (`oc`) for pushing the image to our openshift environment.
* A good internet band-width for uploading the image to Openshift.

To prepare for pushing these images to Openshift:

. Setup an environment variable for the `docker-registry` route in the _default_ namespace: 

+
----
export DOCKER_REGISTRY_HOSTNAME=$(oc get route docker-registry -n default -o template --template='{{.spec.host}}')
----

. Switch to the `client-app` project

+
----
oc project client-app
----

. Create a pusher service account

+
----
oc create serviceaccount pusher
----

. Add `system:image-builder` and `edit` to `pusher` service account

+
----
oc policy add-role-to-user system:image-builder system:serviceaccount:client-app:pusher
oc policy add-role-to-user edit system:serviceaccount:client-app:pusher
----

==== The back office application
. Prepare the values that you will use in the client application configuration, take note (copy them to an available text editor so you can retrieve them in a later step) of the following variable values in the `workstation ssh`, we will use them in the next step:

+
----
echo -en "\n\nhttps://$rhsso_url/auth\n\n
echo -en "\n\nhttps://$ks_url\n\n
----

. Use the `workshop ssh` terminal to configure the environment variables inside the Dockerfile that will be used to build the `hiring-app-internal` image.

+
----
cd $HOME/lab/hiring-app-internal
vi Dockerfile
----

. Using the vi editor, set the proper values to the ENV values:

+
|===
|Get The Value From|Assign to ENV in file|Example
|`echo -en "\n\nhttps://$rhsso_url/auth\n\n"`| SSO_URL |`ENV SSO_URL=https://sso-rhsso-sso0.apps-af16.generic.opentlc.com/auth`
|`echo -en "\n\nhttps://$ks_url\n\n"`| KIE_URL |`ENV KIE_URL=https://rhpam-kieserver-rhpam-dev-user1.apps-af16.generic.opentlc.com`
|===

+
[NOTE]
====
`SSO_REALM` and `SSO_CLIENT` current values assume that you completed the creation of a Red Hat SSO client named as `hiring-internal` in the `kie-realm`. If you perform a different operation in previous sections changing any of these names, please also perform the appropriate changes in the respective environment entry.
====

. Build the `hiring-app-internal` image using *buildah*:

+
----
cd $HOME/lab/hiring-app-internal
sudo buildah bud -t hiring-app-internal:1.0 .
----

. Get the token id for the `pusher` service account in openshift and save it in an environment variable.

+
----
export SA_TOKEN_ID=$(oc describe sa pusher -n client-app | grep Tokens | awk '{print $2}')
echo $SA_TOKEN_ID
----

. Discover the value of the `pusher` service account token and store that value in an environment variable

+
----
export SA_TOKEN=$(oc describe secret $SA_TOKEN_ID -n client-app | grep token: | awk '{print $2}')
echo $SA_TOKEN
----

. Push the image to the openshift registry

+
----
sudo buildah push --tls-verify=false --creds=pusher:$SA_TOKEN hiring-app-internal:1.0 docker-registry-demo-default.apps-8735.generic.opentlc.com/client-app/hiring-app-internal:1.0
----

. In openshift, create a container based in the pushed image.

+
----
oc new-app hiring-app-internal:1.0 -n client-app
----

. Expose the external route to be able to navigate to the `hiring-app-internal`

+
----
oc expose hiring-app-internal -n client-app
----

. Retrieve and navigate using a browser to the newly created back office web application.

+
----
oc get route -n client-app
----

. Login to the client application as *adminuser/admin1!*

. Congratulations you have installed the back office application.

==== The public web application
In this section you repeat almost the same steps than in previous section, to create a container based in the git repository for the `hiring-app-public`: https://github.com/barhte2019/hiring-app-public

. Prepare the values that you will use in the client application configuration, take note (copy them to an available text editor so you can retrieve them in a later step) of the following variable values in the `workstation ssh`, we will use them in the next step:

+
----
echo -en "\n\nhttps://$rhsso_url/auth\n\n
echo -en "\n\nhttps://$ks_url\n\n
----

. Use the `workshop ssh` terminal to configure the environment variables inside the Dockerfile that will be used to build the `hiring-app-internal` image.

+
----
cd $HOME/lab/hiring-app-public
vi Dockerfile
----

. Using the vi editor, set the proper values to the ENV values:

+
|===
|Get The Value From|Assign to ENV in file|Example
|`echo -en "\n\nhttps://$rhsso_url/auth\n\n"`| SSO_URL |`ENV SSO_URL=https://sso-rhsso-sso0.apps-af16.generic.opentlc.com/auth`
|`echo -en "\n\nhttps://$ks_url\n\n"`| KIE_URL |`ENV KIE_URL=https://rhpam-kieserver-rhpam-dev-user1.apps-af16.generic.opentlc.com`

. Congratulations you have installed the public web application.

== Switching the candidate for another job
. Perform an end-to-end job case; creating a new job, defining its interviewer team, skills and benefits; and make a user to apply for that job using the `public-application`

. Once the user applies, approve the documentation and schedule the interviews.

. Login as one of the interviewers and using the newly created *Add Task* button, assign a task to an additional interviewer.

. Login as the additional interviewer and notice the listing of the new task.

Congratulations, you have created a dynamic task. As an *additional challenge*: Can you make an internal application app change that completes the newly created task?
