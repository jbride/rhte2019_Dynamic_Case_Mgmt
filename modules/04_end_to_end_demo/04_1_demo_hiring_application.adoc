== Overview
In this lab we will run the end-to-end cases for candidate selection and interviews in the hiring process, acting as different administrative users and as an applicant to experiment the usage of the platform.

=== Background
One of the departments in our organization wants to hire a new person, so the department raises a hiring petition, which is evaluated for the candidate requisites, interviewer team and compensation; once the job details are defined, the job is automatically posted in the *JOB FINDER* web site, so candidates can start applying for jobs; when a candidate applies the interviewer team can be scheduled and candidate evaluation begins; once a candidate is selected a job offer is generated and the candidate can accept the job offer to complete the case management up to this point.

== OpenStack _Swift_ node for Document Storage

One of the nodes in the environment you have ordered runs an Openstack Swift instance which provides object storage. A container is created in this environment which can store objects. In the lab, offer letters will be stored and retrieved from this storage using a Fuse route. In this section, you will verify that you have access to the Swift object store by running a few curl commands to test it. A cotnainer called TEST and a user called test has been pre-created with a password testing. You will obtain an OAuth token to access the object store API, using the user and password information provided.

. Switch to root user using `sudo -i`
. ssh into the Swift node
+
-----
$ ssh swift.example.com
-----

. Look-up the IP and user information by viewing the /etc/swift/proxy.conf file on the Swift node.
+
-----
$ cat /etc/swift/proxy-server.conf
.....
[DEFAULT]
bind_ip = 192.168.0.20
bind_port = 8080
workers = 8
user = swift


# This is a sample used for functional tests in SAIO. Contains well-known
# passwords.
[filter:tempauth]
use = egg:swift#tempauth
user_admin_admin = ***** .admin .reseller_admin
user_test_tester = testing .admin
user_test2_tester2 = testing2 .admin
user_test_tester3 = testing3
user_test5_tester5 = testing5 service
....
-----

. Issue a swift command to obtain information on the container created for you.
+
-----
$ swift --info --debug  -A http://192.168.0.20:8080/auth/v1.0 -U test:tester -K testing list TEST

. Use the IP obtained in the swift command or from proxy.conf to issue a GET request to obtain the OAuth token

. Create a simple text file under the /tmp directory and issue curl PUT and GET commands to verify that the document can be saved and retrieved. Use the OAuth token output from the previous command here. The x-object-meta-mtime parameter is optional.
