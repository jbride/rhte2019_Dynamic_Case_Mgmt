= End to End Demo

.Prerequisites
.. Environment setup with all infrastructure components mentioned in lab 01 (setup lab): Kie-Server, Business Central, Red Hat SSO and client applications.
.. Web browser able to login to client applications: hiring-app-internal and hiring-app-public.

:numbered:


== Overview
In this lab we will run the end-to-end cases for candidate selection and interviews in the hiring process, acting as different administrative users and as an applicant to experiment the usage of the platform.

=== Background
One of the departments in our organization wants to hire a new person, so the department raises a hiring petition, which is evaluated for the candidate requisites, interviewer team and compensation; once the job details are defined, the job is automatically posted in the *JOB FINDER* web site, so candidates can start applying for jobs; when a candidate applies the interviewer team can be scheduled and candidate evaluation begins; once a candidate is selected a job offer is generated and the candidate can accept the job offer to complete the case management up to this point.

== Department request for jobs
Using the back office application (hiring_app_internal)

. Login as `Tina/Password1!` to the back office application (hiring-app-internal). To remember the route required to navigate to the back office application run the following command in the `ssh workstation`:

----
oc get route -n client-app | grep internal
----

. From the *Dashboard* web page, select the image:images/blue-plus-button.png[Blue plus button] button.

. Fill the *Add Job* form, they are text fields only, it is preferable that you fill all of them.

. Submit the form.

=== What did just happen?

. Open the source code for the hiring-public-app: https://github.com/barhte2019/hiring-app-internal

+
[NOTE]
====
You have multiple options for this:

. You can navigate the source code in gitHub.

. In our previous lab we had cloned this repository to `$HOME/lab` directory in the `remote ssh workstation`, you can also explore the source code there.

. You can also download the source code from gitHub by cloning it to your local environment or by downloading a zip file from gitHub and decompresing it in your local machine. (Although I will strongly suggest this method, we should mind the current available bandwidth)

Im am using this option and navigating the source code using a local installation of link:https://code.visualstudio.com/download[VSCode], use your favorite method and editor.
====

. The `form submit` event can be found at link:https://github.com/barhte2019/hiring-app-internal/blob/master/src/jobs/add-job/index.tsx[`src/jobs/add-job/index.tsx`] you can notice that the form is using a class method `this.submit` at link:https://github.com/barhte2019/hiring-app-internal/blob/master/src/jobs/add-job/index.tsx#L35[line 35].

+
----
<form onSubmit={this.submit}>
----

. The method `submit` from the `AddJobForm` class at link:https://github.com/barhte2019/hiring-app-internal/blob/master/src/jobs/add-job/index.tsx#L85[line 85], prevents default and sets the shared state for other components to take care of storing the data in the back end.

+
----
private submit = (event: React.FormEvent<HTMLFormElement>) => {
    event.preventDefault();
    this.props.onCreateJob(this.props.jobState.newJob);
}
----

. The `onCreateJob` method is injected by `react-redux connect`, this configuration is done at lines:
.. link:https://github.com/barhte2019/hiring-app-internal/blob/master/src/jobs/add-job/index.tsx#L3[line 3]: import `connect` from `react-redux`
.. link:https://github.com/barhte2019/hiring-app-internal/blob/master/src/jobs/add-job/index.tsx#L15[line 15]: import the `createJob` method definition (we will navigate to this definition later in this section), also observe its injection in link:https://github.com/barhte2019/hiring-app-internal/blob/master/src/jobs/add-job/index.tsx#L23[line 23].

. Find the implementation for the `onCreateJob` method at link:https://github.com/barhte2019/hiring-app-internal/blob/master/src/store/jobs/actions.ts#L91[`src/store/jobs/actions.ts`]

+
----
export function createJob(job: IJob) {
    return dispatch => {
        dispatch({ type: JOB_SUBMIT });
        return api.jobs.create(job).then(resp => {
            dispatch(push('/'));
            return dispatch({ type: JOB_CREATED, jobId: resp.data });
        }).catch(err => {
            return dispatch({ type: JOB_CREATED_ERROR, serverErrors: err })
        });
    }
}
----

. The `createJob` method makes use of the redux `dispatch` that invokes the `reducer` to change the state. For example, the reducer for `JOB_SUBMIT` can be found at link:https://github.com/barhte2019/hiring-app-internal/blob/master/src/store/jobs/reducers.ts#L124[`src/store/jobs/reducers.ts`]

+
----
...
case JOB_SUBMIT: {
   return {
       ...state,
       loading: true
   }
}
...
----

. In order to talk to the back end, the `onCreateJob` method defined in link:https://github.com/barhte2019/hiring-app-internal/blob/master/src/store/jobs/actions.ts#L94[`src/store/jobs/actions.ts`] uses the `api`. [red]#This is a very important asset#

+
----
return api.jobs.create(job).then(...).catch(...)
----

. The `api` definition can be found at link:https://github.com/barhte2019/hiring-app-internal/blob/master/src/store/api.ts[`src/store/api.ts`]. Observe that every action that is requested to the API is built here. Information about the `Base URL`, formed with the *kie-server* URL and the `Token` for authentication and authorization with *Red Hat SSO* can be found around link:https://github.com/barhte2019/hiring-app-internal/blob/master/src/store/api.ts#L5[line 5], when defining the *Axios instance*. Then after link:https://github.com/barhte2019/hiring-app-internal/blob/master/src/store/api.ts#L29[line 29] we can find interactions and endpoints with the kie-server REST API.

. Find the API configuration for `jobs.create`

. The `hiring petition` reaches the configured *kie-server* and creates a *Case Instance* based in the received information.

== OpenStack _Swift_ node for Document Storage

One of the nodes in the environment you have ordered runs an Openstack Swift instance which provides object storage. A container is created in this environment which can store objects. In the lab, offer letters will be stored and retrieved from this storage using a Fuse route. In this section, you will verify that you have access to the Swift object store by running a few curl commands to test it. A cotnainer called TEST and a user called test has been pre-created with a password testing. You will obtain an OAuth token to access the object store API, using the user and password information provided. 

. ssh into the workstation node
. Switch to root user using `sudo -i`
. ssh into the Swift node
+
-----
$ ssh swift.example.com
-----

. Look-up the IP and user information by viewing the /etc/swift/proxy.conf file on the Swift node.
+
-----
$ cat /etc/swift/proxy-server.conf
.....
[DEFAULT]
bind_ip = 192.168.0.20
bind_port = 8080
workers = 8
user = swift


# This is a sample used for functional tests in SAIO. Contains well-known
# passwords.
[filter:tempauth]
use = egg:swift#tempauth
user_admin_admin = ***** .admin .reseller_admin
user_test_tester = testing .admin
user_test2_tester2 = testing2 .admin
user_test_tester3 = testing3
user_test5_tester5 = testing5 service
....
-----

. Issue a swift command to obtain information on the container created for you.
+
-----
$ swift --info --debug  -A http://192.168.0.20:8080/auth/v1.0 -U test:tester -K testing list TEST

DEBUG:urllib3.connectionpool:Starting new HTTP connection (1): 192.168.0.20

DEBUG:swiftclient:REQ: curl -i http://192.168.0.20:8080/auth/v1.0 -X GET
DEBUG:swiftclient:RESP STATUS: 200 OK
......
-----

. Use the IP obtained in the swift command or from proxy.conf to issue a GET request to obtain the OAuth token
+
-----

You have verified that in your environment you can access the Swift object storage and store and retrieve files.

== Appendix

=== Optional: Deployment of the Fuse Swift integration
A Fuse REST service is deployed in the Openshift environment to connect to the Openstack Swift node for document storage and retreival. This section explains how the Fuse service is deployed. 

. Using `oc` client, login into your OpenShift envr
. Create a namespace for the application
+
----
$ oc new-project swift-integration
----

. Give the default systemaccount in the namespace cluster view permissions
+
----
$ oc adm policy add-role-to-user view -z default
----

. Create a file ``application.properties``` in a local directory
+
----
swift.host=swift.example.com:8080
swift.username=test:tester
swift.password=testing
swift.container=TEST
----
. Create a configmap ```swift-integration``` in the namespace
+
----
$ oc create configmap swift-integration --from-file=application.properties
----

. Deploy the application with the Fabric8 maven plugin:
+
----
$ mvn clean package fabric8:deploy -Popenshift
----

. Create a local file under the /tmp directory and put an object in Swift:
+
----
$ curl -X PUT -T /tmp/swifttest.txt http://$APP_ROUTE_HOST/api/put?object=test/swifttest.txt
----

. Retrieve an object from Swift:
+
----
$ curl http://$APP_ROUTE_HOST/api/get?object=test/swifttest.txt
----

. Expect to see the contents of the object you inserted in the previous command to be echoes by the get request. You have verified that the Fuse service can successfully interact with the Swift node.
