== Overview
In this workshop you will deploy, manage and develop a platform that assists with a hiring request business process. 
This business process consists of :

. Receiving a *Hiring Petition*
. Evaluation of the *Candidate skills* 
. Execution of other *Hiring requirements* to fulfill the *Job Position*.
. Job Offer Acceptance by the candidate

The scope of the solution is from the *Hiring Petition* to the *Job Offer Acceptance*.
In particular, any business processes after the *Candidate* has been selected is out of the scope of our current platform.

image::images/milestones-overview.png[Milestones Overview]

During the workshop, you will perform the following activities:

* Deploy and configure the most representative parts of the platform, paying attention to the bending and connection points of their infrastructure.
* Execute an end to end demo of the most common cases, specially the happy path.
* Analyze the client applications to find the integration points with the back end components.
* Modify one of the client applications to allow some dynamicity allowed by *Red Hat Process Automation Manager* when working with *Case Management* projects.

The scope of the workshop includes the analysis of an existing platform that integrates *Case Management* with modern Javascript frameworks like *ReactJs* over *NodeJs*. 

=== Background
This workshop is inspired in the original demo created in March 2019 (link:https://gitlab.consulting.redhat.com/uki-sa/pam-demo[PAM Demo]) by link:https://gitlab.consulting.redhat.com/bholmes[Ben Holmes] and his team. Thank you for the inspiration received by a well done project.

In this workshop we will see another example of this implementation with similar flows, but now using a more data-driven case management solution and a different UI approach based on ReactJs (instead of Angular).

=== Deployment Topology

The deployment topology of your _Dynamic Case Management_ solution will be as depicted below:

image::images/arch_topology.png[]

. `pam-7-tools-$guid` 
+
Consists of `pgadmin4` and `Nexus`. 
`pgadmin4` is a web tool used to navigate the databases used in this lab. 
`Nexus` is a online repository for binary Maven artifacts.

. `rhpam-dev-$guid` 
+
In the `RHPAM-DEV` namespace we have the Red Hat Process Automation Manager components for authoring, runtime, database and email.

. `rhsso-sso0` 
+
In the `RHSSO` namespace we have Red Hat SSO for authentication and authorization across our environment.

. `client-app` 
+
The `reactjs` based web application deployed in this namespace will be modified during the workshop to demonstrate its integration with RHPAM.


== Course Virtual Machine

Your lab environment is remote and can be accessed via ssh as well as through your local browser.


=== Order Virtual Machine
This section guides you through the procedure to order a virtual machine (VM) for this course.

include::{lab_order_type}.adoc[]

=== Refresh Process Automation Manager state

Your Process Automation Manager needs to be refreshed with the URL of the Red Hat SSO specific to your lab environment.
For this purpose, a script has been provided as follows:

. Change to the operating system root user with OCP cluster admin privledges:
+
-----
$ sudo -i
-----

. Execute the following refresh script:
+
-----

# mkdir -p $HOME/lab && \
       wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/barhte2019/ansible-deployer/master/casemgmt_state_refresh.sh -O $HOME/lab/casemgmt_state_refresh.sh \
       && chmod 755 $HOME/lab/casemgmt_state_refresh.sh \
       && $HOME/lab/casemgmt_state_refresh.sh
-----

. You should see a response similar to the following:
+
-----
will update the following stale guid in the Process Automation Manager: da7e

Now using project "rhpam-dev-user1" on server "https://master00.example.com:443".
deploymentconfig.apps.openshift.io/rhpam-bc scaled
deploymentconfig.apps.openshift.io/rhpam-kieserver scaled
persistentvolumeclaim "rhpam-bc-claim" deleted
persistentvolumeclaim/rhpam-bc-claim created
deploymentconfig.apps.openshift.io/rhpam-bc patched
deploymentconfig.apps.openshift.io/rhpam-bc scaled

Pause for the following number of seconds: 15
deploymentconfig.apps.openshift.io/rhpam-kieserver patched
deploymentconfig.apps.openshift.io/rhpam-kieserver scaled
-----
+
If you are curious as to what exactly is getting modified in the Process Automation Manager, you can review link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/barhte2019/ansible-deployer/master/casemgmt_state_refresh.sh[the script].
+
In particular, notice that the wildcard DNS of RH-SSO URLs used in the Process Automation Manager are modified.

. After a couple of minutes, expect two of the three RH-PAM pods to have re-started:
+
-----
$ oc get pods -n rhpam-dev-user1

rhpam-bc-3-rvwtn           1/1       Running   1          2m

=== Optional: Review Fuse Document Management Service
A Fuse Camel route has been built in order to support the storage of offer letters documents. 
The Fuse route uses an Openstack Swift backend for document storage and retreival. 

==== Openstack Swift document service [W.I.P]
Openstack Swift provides a REST-based object API for storage and retrieval of documents. 
Clients are authenticated using the X-Auth-Token method, where a userid and password is initially provided to obtain the token. 
Subsequently, the token is used by curl or programmatic clients to access the services.

==== Fuse Camel route for document management
The Fuse route exposes a REST API to the PAM process. 
This API provides 2 methods: a PUT and a GET to store and retrieve the document respectively. 
The Camel route makes uses of processors which allow the user to develop custom code (in this case in Java). 
The Apache HTTP client API is used within the processors to make get and put requests to the Openstack Swift API. 
The Swift-specific parameters such as host, username, password and container name are specified in a configmap and added to the namespace.


==== Optional: Review OpenStack _Swift_ node for Document Storage

One of the nodes in the environment you have ordered runs an Openstack Swift instance which provides object storage. A container is created in this environment which can store objects. In the lab, offer letters will be stored and retrieved from this storage using a Fuse route. In this section, you will verify that you have access to the Swift object store by running a few curl commands to test it. A cotnainer called TEST and a user called test has been pre-created with a password testing. You will obtain an OAuth token to access the object store API, using the user and password information provided.

. ssh into the workstation node
. Switch to root user using `sudo -i`
. ssh into the Swift node

Optional: Review 



=== Optional:  Lab Environment Provisioning
This section provides an overview of the ansible used to provision your own lab environment. 

. Look-up the IP and user information by viewing the /etc/swift/proxy.conf file on the Swift node.
+
-----
$ cat /etc/swift/proxy-server.conf
.....
[DEFAULT]
bind_ip = 192.168.0.20
bind_port = 8080
workers = 8
user = swift

# This is a sample used for functional tests in SAIO. Contains well-known
# passwords.
[filter:tempauth]

user_admin_admin = ***** .admin .reseller_admin
user_test_tester = testing .admin
user_test2_tester2 = testing2 .admin
user_test_tester3 = testing3
user_test5_tester5 = testing5 service
....
-----

. Issue a swift command to obtain information on the container created for you.
+
-----
$ swift --info --debug  -A http://192.168.0.20:8080/auth/v1.0 -U test:tester -K testing list TEST

You have verified that in your environment you can access the Swift object storage and store and retrieve files.

==== Deployment of the Fuse Swift integration
A Fuse REST service is deployed in the Openshift environment to connect to the Openstack Swift node for document storage and retreival. This section explains how the Fuse service is deployed.

. Using `oc` client, login into your OpenShift envr
. Create a namespace for the application
+
----
$ oc new-project swift-integration
----

. Give the default systemaccount in the namespace cluster view permissions
+
----
$ oc adm policy add-role-to-user view -z default
----

. Create a file ``application.properties``` in a local directory
+
----
swift.host=swift.example.com:8080
swift.username=test:tester
swift.password=testing
swift.container=TEST
----
. Create a configmap ```swift-integration``` in the namespace
+
----
$ oc create configmap swift-integration --from-file=application.properties
----

. Deploy the application with the Fabric8 maven plugin:
+
----
$ mvn clean package fabric8:deploy -Popenshift
----

. Examine the OpenAPI specification of the API using the following curl command:
+
----
$ curl http://$APP_ROUTE_HOST/api-docs
----

. Create a local file under the /tmp directory and put an object in Swift:
+
----
$ curl -X PUT -T /tmp/swifttest.txt http://$APP_ROUTE_HOST/api/put?object=test/swifttest.txt
----

. Retrieve an object from Swift:
+
----
$ curl http://$APP_ROUTE_HOST/api/get?object=test/swifttest.txt
----

. Expect to see the contents of the object you inserted in the previous command to be echoes by the get request. You have verified that the Fuse service can successfully interact with the Swift node.
