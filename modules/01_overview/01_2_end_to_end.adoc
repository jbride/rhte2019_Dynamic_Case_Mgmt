== Overview
In this lab we will run the end-to-end cases for candidate selection and interviews in the hiring process, acting as different administrative users and as an applicant to experiment the usage of the platform.

=== Background
One of the departments in our organization wants to hire a new person, so the department raises a hiring petition, which is evaluated for the candidate requisites, interviewer team and compensation; once the job details are defined, the job is automatically posted in the *JOB FINDER* web site, so candidates can start applying for jobs; when a candidate applies the interviewer team can be scheduled and candidate evaluation begins; once a candidate is selected a job offer is generated and the candidate can accept the job offer to complete the case management up to this point.

== Installing client applications
Client applications for this lab are ReactJs websites over a NodeJs server that interact with the kie-server deployed in Openshift during the previous lab.
To install the web sites be sure to have at reach:

* The RH-SSO KIE-REALM / kie-server client JSON configuration for an external application.
* The KIE-SERVER external route

=== The back office application
The back office application is a web site developed using ReactJs, Redux and Patternfly over NodeJs. This back office web site's source code project is: https://github.com/barhte2019/hiring-app-internal

The back office application allows administrative users like *Talent Acquisition*, *HR* or the *Department interested in hiring* to manage the *Hiring Petitions* and *Candidates*.
